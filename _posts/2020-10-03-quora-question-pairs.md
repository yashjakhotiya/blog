# Introduction
Hello friends, same questions identify kar lo.

# Problem definition
Identifying when to say "pehle hi toh pucha tha ye, phir kyu puch raha hai?"

# Methods
Create a sentient AI that will do this task. Jk. Fit together random off the shelf models.

# Potential results and discussion 
We build skynet.

# References
1. Kaggle - Already created notebooks
2. GitHub - For code which we didn't find on Kaggle
3. YouTube - Cat videos for break times.

# Timeline and responsibilites
All of us are project managers so nobody will do actual work.
