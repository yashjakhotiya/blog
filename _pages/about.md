A software developer with interests in machine learning, open source and site-reliability engineering, I currently work at [D.E. Shaw](https://www.deshaw.com/), a New York based hedge fund.

I have previously worked at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore as a deep learning summer research intern. My work there was based on Generative Adversarial Networks and sequence-to-sequence modelling.
